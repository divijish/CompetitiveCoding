# CompetitiveCoding

Usage:
This template is for writing and testing java code.
It takes values from input.txt and puts result in output.txt.

If it doesn't find the input.txt file, it takes input from System.in.
Similarly, if it doesn't find output.txt file, it publishes output to System.out.

One can use FastReader's object to read data and FastOutput's object to write data.

One can use UserSnippet.json and put it in VSCode snippet. This way, a snippet shortcut is created and whenver one wants to use this template they just have to write "mct" in a blank file in VS Code and the entire thing would pe pasted in that file. Just rename that file to Main.java later and then one can run it.

This template works smoothly with CPH Judge(https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DivyanshuAgrawal.competitive-programming-helper) extension and one can give test cases are runtime to test their code.
